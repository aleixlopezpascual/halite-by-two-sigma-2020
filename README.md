## Overview
Halite is an online multiplayer game created by Two Sigma. In the game, four participants command ships to collect an energy source called halite. The player with the most halite at the end of the game wins. In this competition, you had to write your own intelligent bot to play the game. Due to the arbitrary number of units (ships/bases), a long episode duration, a dynamic opponent pool and a finite computation time, the problem was very difficult to tackle using Deep RL. Therefore, I decided to apply heuristics.
